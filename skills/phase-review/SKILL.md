# Instructions

Read all references in `references/` before using this skill.

## Multi-Agent Awareness

**IMPORTANT:** Multiple agents may be working on different phases concurrently. Post-implementation review must verify:

1. **Integration with concurrent work** — Did other phases modify the same files during implementation?
2. **Merge correctness** — If merges occurred, were they done correctly?
3. **Build stability** — Does the combined state of all concurrent work pass quality gates?
4. **Documentation alignment** — Do coordination notes (if any) match what actually happened?

When reviewing, always:
- Check git status for changes from other agents
- Verify build/lint against the current combined state (not just this phase's changes)
- Note any multi-agent coordination that occurred in the review

See `08_MULTI_AGENT_COORDINATION.md` for detailed procedures.

## Signals

- The user says: "review the phase", "post-implementation review", "did we finish phase N", "wrap up the phase", "verify the plan", "phase review".
- A `docs/planning/phase-<N>/plan.md` exists and implementation work has occurred.
- You need to confirm quality gates (at minimum: `npm run lint`, `npm run build`) and document results.
