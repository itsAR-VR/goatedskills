# Instructions

Read all references in `references/` before using this skill.

## Multi-Agent Awareness

**IMPORTANT:** Multiple agents may be working on different phases concurrently. During execution:

1. **Before each subphase:** Run `git status` and re-read files you plan to modify
2. **When you encounter unexpected file state:** Another agent may have modified the file — check the last 10 phases
3. **When builds fail unexpectedly:** Check for schema changes or API changes from other phases
4. **Document conflicts:** Log any coordination issues in your subphase Output section

If a file you need has been modified by another phase:
- Read the other phase's plan.md to understand their changes
- Merge semantically (don't just overwrite)
- Note the integration in your Output section

See `06_MULTI_AGENT_COORDINATION.md` for detailed procedures.

## Signals

- The user says "execute the phase", "work through the subphases", "continue the plan"
- A phase folder exists with a root `plan.md` and subphase folders ready
- Work needs to proceed through an established planning structure
