# Intent

Execute an existing planning phase in `docs/planning/phase-<N>/` by completing subphases in alphabetical order (a, b, c, ...), producing tangible outputs and preserving rationale.

The skill walks through each subphase sequentially, updating only the active subphase's `plan.md`, appending outputs and handoffs, and finishing by checking off success criteria in the root `plan.md`.
