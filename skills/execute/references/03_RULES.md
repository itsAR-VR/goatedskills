# Execution Rules (non-negotiable)

- Only modify `docs/planning/phase-<N>/<active-letter>/plan.md` while executing work.
- Do NOT rewrite previous subphases once completed.
- Each subphase must end with:
  - a concrete **Output** (what changed, what was decided, what was produced)
  - an explicit **Handoff** to the next letter
- If scope expands:
  - create a new subphase letter folder + `plan.md`
  - update the root Subphase Index by appending the new entry
  - do NOT alter earlier subphase plans
